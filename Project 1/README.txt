RUNNING THE PROGRAM:
The program Runner.java has a main method inside it which handles user interaction and all other classes.

You can run the main program "Runner.java" by compiling it using the javac and java commands, 
or by running it inside an IDE using the RUN button.

In case you want to, here are the commands to manually compile and run the program:
javac Runner.java
java Runner

INTERACTING WITH THE PROGRAM:
When prompted, options 1 and 2 allow you to enter your own input or have the program randomize a board.

If you choose option 3, the program will read from a file. I have programmed it so that it can read the 
example files Dr.Tang attached, such as Length4.txt, Length8.txt, so on.
It skips the first line of slashes, then reads the next 3 lines of numbers in a loop, and will read the whole text file.
